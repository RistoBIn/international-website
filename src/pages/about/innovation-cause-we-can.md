SEALAB offers a comprehensive portfolio of IT solutions and programming for use in the ocean space. Employees have experience in a vast range of sectors, markets and technical disciplines, which gives SEALAB an unrivalled level of knowledge and expertise.

Our new camera is completely groundbreaking in marine environments and uses up to six lenses. The optics are optimized for use in several tasks in the Ocean Space. SEALAB's basic camera DNA is of course essential. The data platform has several separate lenses that are combined and used together. Thus, you get both 2D and 3D images using advanced software and Artificial Intelligence that gives you pictures in unparalleled detail, regardless of lighting conditions - regardless of depth.

This, in combination with the image sensors being SEALAB's largest ever, makes it possible to get exceptionally good night pictures below the surface. Clear and colorful images that far exceed what you can see with the naked eye. And best of all, Intel inside.

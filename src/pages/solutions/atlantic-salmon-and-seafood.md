      The Norwegian Aquaculture is already being improved by SEALAB's solutions
      through sharp images which in turn provides a better basis for the
      customer. And now comes many new innovations thanks to our unique edge
      computing technology combined with smart 2D and 3D subsea cameras:
      measuring stress in fish, better lining regime, monitoring the entire
      state of the cage. All of this helps to reduce losses and can provide a
      better survival rate. The economic benefits are increased at the farms
      while managing to reduce the environmental impact caused by salmon
      feeding.

    SEALAB are developing System on Chip (SoC) with FPGA technology inside that
    fulfil the most demanding computer vision and AI tasks. The on-chip
    processing gets past challenges around massive data generation and poor
    image quality by doing the processing in the camera unit itself. Our system
    on chip can be customised for different cameras, and remotely reprogrammed
    to perform even more advanced tasks.

    If you are interested in upgrading your underwater camera with FPGA
    technology from SEALAB, contact us for a meeting.

    Edge computing is about processing at the points in the value chain where it
    is useful and efficient. Machine vision and Artificial Intelligence require
    a data volume, data quality, and frequency that challenge earlier paradigms
    such as cloud computing. Instead of transporting all data to the cloud,
    important processing is done at the edge. A AI application that could
    benefit from this is biomass estimation.

    In order to succeed with edge computing, it is not sufficient only being
    capable of programming the FPGA, understanding the industry and which
    problems the chip should solve is just as important. SEALAB is uniquely
    positioned for solving this task because:

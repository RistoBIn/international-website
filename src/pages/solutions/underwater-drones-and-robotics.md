      Underwater drones equipped with high-tech sensors and edge computing in
      participation with smart cameras could one day patrol the icy waters of
      both Arctic and Antarctic, to help keep an eye on the region’s growing
      shipping traffic—and to be on the lookout for foreign submarines. And on
      top of that: environmental monitoring.

      ## Support for machine vision

       As with most technology developments, the future of robotic vision has two parents — government and private industry. To success with underwater drones, you will need smart 2D and 3D cameras from SEALAB in combination with the company’s FPGA technology and behind that - a sweep of sensors. Static data understanding has three goals: classify objects in the image; understand relationships between objects in the image, such as which ones are closer than others and which objects are moving; and determine how the objects in the image relate to the people viewing the image.

      The second part of machine vision dynamic analysis. This considers how
      objects in an image relate to one another over time, their movement, and
      whether or not each object is important. In a machine vision application
      aboard an unmanned underwater drone or vessel at the surface, for example,
      you then have to determine what to do about what is seen, which gets into
      autonomy.

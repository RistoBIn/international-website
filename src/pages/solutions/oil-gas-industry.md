      AI, IoT, Edge Computing and smart camera technology from SEALAB can
      minimize the risk of accidents on drilling rigs in the Oil & Gas Industry.
      But also pipeline inspections underwater, monitoring and measurement of
      wear on anchoring and mooring will be able to do with camera with built-in
      machine vision.


      A secure rig is an effective rig. The drilling deck on a rig is the
      so-called "red zone" the most dangerous area you can be in. However, the
      drill crew must constantly come in and do a job. Normally, the staff must
      have approval from the control room to move into this area, and then with
      radio contact and visual monitoring or by being equipped with sensors.

    Monitoring using artificial intelligence helps the system monitor all
    movement of equipment and crew. SEALAB develops the next-generation safety
    system and the same technology used in driverless cars. The system can
    detect people and equipment in motion and give the drill manager a warning
    if someone is in the wrong zone, for example. SEALABs FPGA technology works
    with both 2D and 3D camera setup.

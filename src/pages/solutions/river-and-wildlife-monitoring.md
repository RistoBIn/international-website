      Increased production of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) worldwide and
      declining wild salmonid populations have caused concerns that salmon
      aquaculture is a major driver of abundance and viability of wild salmonid
      populations.

    ### Escaping fish is one of the environmental challenges for the Norwegian
    aquaculture industry
  right: >-
    Fish can escape from both onshore plants (through the drain) and plants in
    the sea. Escaping has been pointed out as a serious problem for many years.
    The reasons why the fish are escaping are many. Escapes can occur during
    operation and handling of the nets, such as when removing salmon lice, or it
    can occur in connection with sorting, fish harvest or changing the nets.
    Escaping may also occur due to technical defects, wear and tear from
    weights, collisions with boats or due to bad weather.


    After escaping, the farmed salmon can get lost in the sea, but can also swim
    up a river to spawn. For many, this is highlighted as the greatest
    environmental threat, because escaped farm salmon that spawn with wild
    salmon could affect the genes of the wild salmon and thus make it less
    robust.


    Work is being carried out to monitor the rivers in Norway, which includes
    assessment of the quantity of escaped farmed salmon that exist. This work is
    being done within a national monitoring programme for escaped salmon. The
    fish farmers have a shared responsibility for fishing out escaped farmed
    fish. In addition, the condition of the wild salmon stocks is assessed every
    year. This is done by the Scientific Advisory Committee for Atlantic Salmon
    (Vitenskapelig råd for lakseforvaltning, VRL).
